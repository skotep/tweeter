## Hack Rice 2016 - Web Development Workshop

This is the starter for the Hack Rice 2016 Web Development Workshop.

### Getting started

0. Before we begin you will need NPM installed on your computer.  Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to get it.

1.  Then clone the git repository to get all the starter files:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:skotep/tweeter hackRiceTweeter
cd hackRiceTweeter
```

2. Next we'll use Node's package manager npm to install our dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```
this may take a little while.  There may be a couple of errors, most of which are really warnings.  If the next step doesn't work then ask for help.

3. When done we will boot the web server:

```sh
npm start
```

4. Navigate your web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the site.

5. Let's get hacking and make our Twitter clone!
